oh my God I think I may have just found the most life-changing b******* ever why am I not using GitHub or just a text file to talk to myself but not actually be talking to myself to actually be possibly working through some healing b******* why am I not using technology to improve and betterment my life probably really good idea and if I use these principles for my professional and they work for my professional life they get quite possibly work in my personal life to help me stay on top of an organized me and the really neat thing about it is I mean I'm not saying that this negates the need for a girlfriend but like when I'm feeling lonely and I need to talk or text someone I can do this as potential alternative I mean otherwise all I do is annoy people

PROJECT: Recipies

   Weight Loss Soup
      64 ounces chicken broth you may use low-sodium
      6 cups V-8 juice *see recipe notes
      56 ounces Italian diced tomatoes
      2 small onion
      4 cloves minced garlic
      16 ounces sliced mushrooms
      6 carrots peeled and sliced
      2 zucchini diced
      2 yellow squash diced
      4 cups green beans fresh or frozen
      28 ounces kidney beans drained and rinsed
      6-8 cups shredded cabbage
      2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
      Salt and Pepper to taste

      In a large crockpot, combine sautéed garlic and vegetables with the remaining ingredients.
